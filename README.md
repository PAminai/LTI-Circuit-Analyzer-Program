# LTI-Circuit-Analyzer-Program
This Program contains more than 1000 lines of codes for simulation of different type of circuits based on node modified method. As a result it is able to solve all kind of LTI circuits. This program is also able to analyze the circuits and gives all of following informations:

* Zero-state and Zero-input Response
* Natural Frequency
* Network Function in Laplace domain and plot it in frequency domain
* Impulse Response and plot it in time domain


This program supports circuits with following elements:

* Linear Resistors
* Linear Capacitors and Inductors with initial condition
* Coupling elements
* Dependent and independent current and voltage sources
* ac and DC inputs

The output of program can optionally be determined by ueser in the format of **Data.txt** file which is the input of MATLAB codes. This project is also includes a **Help (Persian).pdf** which releases How to input the data from a circuit to the program.
