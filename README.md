# LTI-Circuit-Analyzer-Program
This Program contains more than 1000 lines of codes for simulation of different type of circuits based on node modified method. As a result it is abale to solve all kind of LTI circuits. This program is also able to analyze the circuits and gives all of following informations:

* Zero-state and Zero-input Response
* Natural Frequency
* Network Function in Laplace domain and plot it in frequency domain
* Impulse Response and plot it in time domain
