# LTI-Circuit-Analyzer-Program
This Program contains more than 1000 lines of codes for simulation of different type of circuits based on node modified method. It is able to solve all kind of LTI circuits. This program is also able to analyze the circuits and gives all of following informations:

* Zero-state and Zero-input Response
* Natural Frequency
* Network Function in Laplace domain and plot it in frequency domain
* Impulse Response and plot it in time domain


This program supports circuits with following elements:

* Linear Resistors
* Linear Capacitors and Inductors with initial condition
* Coupling elements
* Dependent and independent current and voltage sources
* ac and DC inputs

Program outputs can be specified by uesers in the format of **Data.txt** file which is the input of MATLAB codes. This project also contains **Help (Persian).pdf** which explains how to enter data and some preparation before running the program.
